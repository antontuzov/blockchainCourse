# DeFi Protocol Capstone Project

## Overview
This project involves creating a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol with core DeFi functionalities including trading, lending, and yield farming.

## Features to Implement
1. Decentralized exchange with order book or AMM
2. Lending and borrowing system with collateral management
3. Liquidity pools with reward distribution
4. Yield farming mechanisms with staking
5. Token swap functionality
6. Governance features

## Implementation Guidelines
- Implement secure financial mechanisms
- Create efficient token swap algorithms
- Build robust lending and borrowing systems
- Design liquidity pool management
- Develop staking and reward mechanisms
- Include risk management and security measures
- Provide comprehensive testing and documentation
