# Enterprise Blockchain Platform Capstone Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building an enterprise-grade blockchain platform with permissioned access control and multi-tenant capabilities.

## Features to Implement
1. Permissioned blockchain with role-based access control
2. Smart contract platform with virtual machine
3. Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation
4. Integration APIs and SDKs
5. Certificate authority integration
6. Channel/namespace system

## Implementation Guidelines
- Implement membership services for user authentication
- Create secure role-based access control system
- Build virtual machine for smart contract execution
- Design multi-tenant architecture with proper isolation
- Develop RESTful APIs and language SDKs
- Include comprehensive testing and documentation
